BazingaFakerBundle
==================

This bundle integrates [Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker), a PHP
library that generates fake data for you.  It provides a command to load random
data for your model objects as simple as possible.


Usage
-----

In real life, you'll have to populate your database with data. It's often a pain
because it requires imagination and time you probably don't have or you don't
want to waste. Faker to the rescue!

You just have to configure your entities to populate, then run the
`faker:populate` command to add new data without effort.  It's better than
fixtures because you don't need to write anything. If you drop your database,
then re create it and load fresh data.


Installation
------------

Require [`willdurand/faker-bundle`](https://packagist.org/packages/willdurand/faker-bundle)
to your `composer.json` file:

``` json
{
    "require": {
        "willdurand/faker-bundle": "@stable"
    }
}
```

Register the bundle in `app/AppKernel.php`:

    // app/AppKernel.php
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        return array(
            // ...
            new Bazinga\Bundle\FakerBundle\BazingaFakerBundle(),
        );
    }

Enable the bundle's configuration in `app/config/config.yml`:

``` yaml
# app/config/config.yml
bazinga_faker:Â ~
```


Reference Configuration
-----------------------

In order to use the `BazingaFakerBundle`, you have to configure it.

First of all if you use Doctrine or Mandango instead of Propel you must define
it so that the bundle can reconfigure itself:

``` yaml
# app/config/config*.yml

bazinga_faker:
    orm: doctrine
```

``` yaml
# app/config/config*.yml

bazinga_faker:
    orm: mandango
```

Afterwards you just need to configure which entities you want to populate and in
which quantity (default: 5).

``` yaml
# app/config/config*.yml

bazinga_faker:
    entities:
        Acme\LibraryBundle\Model\Author:
            number: 5
        Acme\LibraryBundle\Model\Book:
            number: 5
            custom_formatters:
                Isbn:   { method: lexify, parameters: [ '?????????????' ] }
```

You can add your own formatter for each column of each entity:

``` yaml
bazinga_faker:
    entities:
        Acme\LibraryBundle\Model\Book:
            custom_formatters:
                Isbn:   { method: randomElement, parameters: [ [ 'aaaaaaaaaa', 'bbbbbbbb', 'cccccccc' ] ] }
```

You can use all formatters provided by Faker, with or without arguments:

``` yaml
bazinga_faker:
    entities:
        Acme\LibraryBundle\Model\Book:
            custom_formatters:
                Isbn:   { method: word }
```

You can also set `null` to a column value in order to get the default value
generated by a behavior (e.g. Propel behaviors):

``` yaml
bazinga_faker:
    entities:
        Acme\LibraryBundle\Model\Book:
            custom_formatters:
                Slug:   { method: null }
```

There are a few more optional settings available for more advanced customization
of faker:

``` yaml
bazinga_faker:
    seed:       1234
    locale:     en_GB
    populator:  Your\Own\Populator
    entity:     Your\Own\EntityPopulator
```

Adding additional providers to the generator is as easy as registering a tagged service to the container:

``` yaml
services:
    faker.provider.my_customer_provider:
        class: Acme\LibraryBundle\Faker\MyCustomerProvider
        arguments: [@faker.generator]
        tags:
            - { name: bazinga_faker.provider }
```


Command
-------

The bundle provides a new Symfony2 command: `faker:populate` which will populate
all configured entities.

    php app/console faker:populate
